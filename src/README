ocaml-gettext
--------------

This library is a wrapper around gettext
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html), it also provides a pure
Ocaml implementation based on camomile.

The primary target of this work is to bring internationalization to 
cameleon ( http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cameleon/ ). Before i 
can do it, i need to test and test this library... ( so i package it
and try to use it with some program of my creation... ).

Feel free to use it in your application. There is no real doc coming
with it, but i will prepare some in the next future.
